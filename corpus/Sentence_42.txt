Moreover, galanthamine, an allosteric modulator of alpha4beta2alpha5 nAChR, enhanced the ACh-induced depression of corticothalamic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), indicating that alpha4beta2alpha5 nAChRs at corticothalamic axon terminals specifically contribute to the depression of corticothalamic synaptic transmission.
