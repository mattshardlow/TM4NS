We next used stimulation and recording techniques in forelimb intact rats (n=5) and examined the pattern of projection (a) from the forelimb and shoulder to SI, (b) from the forepaw and shoulder to VPL , and (c) from sites in the forepaw and shoulder representation in VPL to forelimb and shoulder sites in SI.
