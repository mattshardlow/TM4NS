We found that (1) some basal ganglia-linked and reticular thalamic cells fire preferentially near the beginning of Up states; (2) thalamic cells fire more selectively at a given Up-state phase than do CTh cells; (3) CTh and thalamic cells exhibit different action potential timings within spindle cycles; and (4) neurons exhibit different firing characteristics when comparing their activity during Up states and DSs.
