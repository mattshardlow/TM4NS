These results indicate that a multi-compartment model with passive dendrites cannot fully reproduce the experimental activity of thalamocortical neurons, while both uniform and non-uniform somato-dendritic g(T) and g(K) distributions are compatible with the properties of the delta oscillation and the retinal excitatory postsynaptic potential recorded in vitro from the soma of these neurons.
