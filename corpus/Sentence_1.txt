In normal rats, clusters of immunoreactive cell bodies were found in: (i) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus pars medialis (VLGM), (ii) the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), (iii) the intermediate region between the VLGM and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus pars lateralis (VLGL), (iv) the caudomedial portion of the VLGM, and (v) the caudolateral portion of the VLGM.
