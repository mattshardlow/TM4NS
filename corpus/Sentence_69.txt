Abstract: The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis ( nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy.
