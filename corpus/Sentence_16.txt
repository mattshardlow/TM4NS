NEURON allows the development of simulations at any level of complexity, from subcellular components to single cells, cellular networks, and system-level models., Focusing on an in vitro cell model of a single, acutely isolated thalamic neuron, we used the simulation environment to address and to discuss the following questions in an undergraduate course: (i) Which parts are required to design a single compartment with passive electrical properties? (ii) Which components are necessary to model a single action potential or a train of action potentials? (iii) What can we learn from voltage-clamp and current-clamp experiments? (iv) What kind of cellular parameters are accessible from the modeling data? (v) What are the differences between single-compartment models and multi-compartment models? (vi) What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial cell models? (vii) Can realistic modeling open up new strategies to discover the way that neurons process information?
