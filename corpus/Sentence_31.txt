The initial bursting rhythm resulted from the interaction of ITs and IK(Ca), with a slow after-depolarization due to ICAN which mediated the later tonic firing; 3) with further depolarization of the membrane potential positive to approximately -61 mV, sustained tonic firing appeared in the 10-200-Hz frequency range depending on the amplitude of the injected current.
