A uniform somato-dendritic distribution of the maximal conductance of I(T) and I(K) (g(T) and g(K), respectively) was sufficient to simulate with acceptable accuracy: (i) the delta oscillation, and its phase resetting by somatically injected current pulses; as well as (ii) the retinal excitatory postsynaptic potential, and its alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionate and/or N-methyl-D-aspartate components.
