By using immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against whole rat choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), we quantified the distribution and characterized the ultrastructural features of these nerve terminals (axon varicosities) in the dorsolateral geniculate (DLG), parafascicular (PF), and reticular thalamic (Rt) nuclei of adult rat.
